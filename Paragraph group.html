</div>
<div id="body">
<p>There are two ways to start a new paragraph: you can skip a line (using Enters) or indent (using Tabs). In terms of genre: white lines are often used in technical writing (e.g. reports), indentation is mostly used in academic writing (e.g. academic research articles), but there are exceptions.&nbsp;Make sure that you are consistent throughout your document.</p>
<p>Paragraphs should not cover more than one topic. Therefore, it is important to check: if you notice that a new topic is introduced, you should start a new paragraph.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a pice of text that consists of one paragraph. It will become much more readable by splitting it up into separate paragraphs. Can you find the spots where to start a new paragraph?</p>
