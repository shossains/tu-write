<p>It is almost impossible to produce a flawless reference list. Yet, you have to strive for it. Mistakes are easily made, but can also easily be prevented.</p>
<p>These are the mistakes that are most often seen in students&rsquo; work:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full stop after each reference is missing.</li>
<li>Forms of address have been added (e.g. prof. and dr.).</li>
<li>There is no uniformity between references.</li>
<li>The article title is put in italics instead of the journal title.</li>
<li>Only the first author of the text is mentioned, whereas the reference style prescribed that more or all authors are mentioned.</li>
<li>Layout hampers comprehension.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tip</b></p>
<p>Many journals offer a service you can use to create references in the preferred reference output style. If you use these, you should always check if all information is correct and in the right place.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Next you will see five examples of references that are fine: the source can be found with the information that is provided. However, the devil is in the detail.</p>
<p>Do you spot all&nbsp;problems?</p>
