<h1 id="decorative">The first sentence: it better be good</h1>
</div>
<p>When you meet someone new, the first impression counts. A first sentence such as: 'Haven't we met before?', probably does not work very well for someone to become interested.</p>
<p>The same goes for the first sentence of your introduction. A successful first sentence entices your reader to read on, to become interested in your subject. Three strategies to achieve this, are listed below. For each strategy, an example is added for a text in which a design for a bio-inspired jumping robot is presented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Start with some interesting or astonishing facts and figures about your subject.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.65em; text-indent: 0pt; font-size: 12pt;">In nature, the flea is king when it comes to jumping: it can jump as far as 220 times its own body length and as high as 150 times its body height.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>2. Give an interesting example that immediately clarifies the problem that you are addressing in your text.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.65em; text-indent: 0pt; font-size: 12pt;">When a three year old child is asked to jump into the air, it will effortlessly do so and land safely on its feet without falling down.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>3. Begin with a relevant quote. Make sure that the quote is relevant for your subject.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.65em; text-indent: 0pt; font-size: 12pt;">Duncan Haldane, a PhD student at the University of California at Berkeley and engaged with research into bio-inspired engineering, in an interview with LiveScience explained what the main challenges are when designing a jumping robot: "When you are doing bio-inspired engineering, you have to drastically simplify what you are seeing in nature and figure out the fundamental principles of what is going on."</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Match the feedback</h2>
<p>This exercise helps you understand what you should avoid when writing a good first sentence. Below you will find four examples of first sentences from student papers in the field of&nbsp;Molecular Science and Technology. All four sentences&nbsp;have issues on which the students' teachers gave&nbsp;feedback.</p>
<p>Match each feedback item with the sentence that it concerns.</p>
