<h1 id="decorative">The art of abstract writing</h1>
<p>Summaries can be found in reports, whereas abstracts are usually found in scientific papers. Note that an abstract is a summary, but a summary is not an abstract. Find out about similarities and differences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Differences</b></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Summaries are short, but abstracts are even shorter. Regarding the latter, usually a single lean paragraph will do, whereas a summary often takes one A4.</li>
<li>Abstracts never have figures or tables. In a summary important figures or tables may be added.</li>
<li>Summaries are never paired with keywords. Abstracts often are.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><b>Similarities</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract and summary are both written in complete sentences.</li>
<li>
<p>Abstract and summary are both written in the present simple and the past simple, because they answer four questions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>What is it about? &ndash; Present simple</li>
<li>What did you do? &ndash; Past simple</li>
<li>What did you find? &ndash; Past simple</li>
<li>What does it mean? &ndash; Present simple</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abstract and summary both include definitions of technical abbreviations. However, as the audience of a science paper mostly consists of specialists, you need not explain what is obvious to them.</li>
</ul>
