<h1 id="decorative">The first sentence of a paragraph is the topic sentence</h1>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>Ideally, the topic sentence is the first sentence of a paragraph. This is where most readers expect it to be. A reader with little time will scan a text by reading the first sentences of the paragraphs. If the text has been constructed well, he will get a pretty good idea of the contents, as the topic sentence gives the most important information of a paragraph.</p>
<p>After you have examined an example, you will see that there are two types of topic sentences: announcements and statements.</p>
<h2>Find the topic</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a paragraph. What is the topic? Read carefully and answer the question.</p>

<h2>Two types</h2>
<p>There are two types of topic sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Type 1: Announcement<br /></b>This topic sentence announces what will be discussed in a paragraph.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Type 2: Statement<br /></b>This topic sentence is a statement that contains the subject of the paragraph. The remainder of the paragraph supports or clarifies the statement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluate two paragraphs</h2>
<p>Which paragraph starts with a statement? Which with an announcement?</p>
