</div>
<div id="body">
<p><strong>Rule 1</strong></p>
<p>Present&nbsp;your recommendations directly after the conclusion. If you have many recommendations, you can discuss them in a proper chapter. If you only have a few recommendations to give, it is best to place them in one chapter with the conclusion. Discuss them in a final paragraph and tell how&nbsp;many recommendations you have. You can also add a heading. In this way, your recommendations can be read as a stand-alone document.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations have to be feasible, appropriate, specific and encouraging.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>In this challenge you are asked to assess four pairs of recommendations. Each pair presents one of the features (see rule 2).</p>

<p>The recommendations have been extracted from reports written by first year students Computer Science. The students&nbsp; have to write the code for a bot team that is able to independently win StarCraft, a computer game. The report is about the building process and the results. The recommendations are meant for those who have to do the same project next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if you can find the recommendation that meets the feature best.</p>
