<p>Beginning academic writers often find it very difficult to decide where and when they should place references in their writing. Though there are some rules for using in-text citations, it is also a matter of developing a feeling for when and how to do this. The best way to develop this feeling, is to look at your academic reading in two different ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Read for content</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Take notes about content that seems interesting for your own writing. Make sure that you distinguish clearly between your own paraphrases of the content and literal quotations from the text. Mark literal quotations with quotation marks (&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;), so that you know that these are the exact words of the author.</p>
<p><strong>2. Learn from other authors</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While you are reading for content, keep an eye open for when and how in-text citations are used. In this way you will learn how other authors provide in-text citations, for example: when providing a definition that was formulated elsewhere; when presenting facts and figures from another source; when paraphrasing the main ideas from a journal paper or a book.</p>
<h2>Examine</h2>
<p>Examine three ways of telling a story: from an author-oriented viewpoint; from a subject-oriented viewpoint, and from a time-oriented viewpoint.</p>
